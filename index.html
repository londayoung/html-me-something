        <p>On July 4th of 2019, twenty-two memebers of my family embarked on our very first family vacation. In the
            begenning, I was hesitant. With only 6 adults and 16 children, I thought it would be a disaster. However,
            our 2019 family vacation turned out to be my favorite trip thus far. </p>

        <h2> Traveling day:</h2>
        <p> Our first day was spent traveling. After getting the children packed and ready, we headed to the airport in
            5 seperate cars. Most of my family had never been on an air plane, so the ride to the airport was full of
            excitment and nervousness.

            <h2> Destination: Disney</h2>
            <p> Everyone was excited to board the Disney Magical Express with a set destination of Disney world!
                Although we all stayed in a Disney resort, it was nearly impossible to find one resort that could
                accomodate 22 people of the same party. This was not an issue since our resorts were within walking
                distance of eachother. Half of my family stayed at Disney's Art of Animation and the other half of us
                staryed at Disney's Pop Century Resort. </p>

                <h2>Dinsey Theme Parks</h2>
                <p> After taking a family poll, we dicided on three Disney parks:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Disney's Magic Kingdom</li>
                        <li>Disney's Epcot</li>
                        <li>Disney's Animal Kingdom</li>
                    </ul>
                    We made a detailed agenda for our trip. We took into considering each child's favorite character and
                    scheduled everything including fast passes for attractions, meals and even naps. Unfortunatly
                    when preparing our agenda, we did not account for any weather changes, time restrictions or temper
                    tanturms. A few hours in to our second day, we realized that the agenda was null and void. While
                    this did complicate things, we were determind to have a great time.
                </p>
                <h3>Dinsey's Magic Kingdom</h3>
                <p> Disney's Magic kingdon was fun for everyone. The weather was good and the lines were moving fast.
                    The <strong>four</strong> double strollers we rented really came in handy as kids became tired from
                    walking long distances in the heat.</p>

                    <h3>Dinsey's Epcot</h3>
                    <p> There was a pretty bad rain storm on the morning of our visit to Disney's Epcot. At first we
                        were sadden to cancel our plans. Then, we decided to not let the rain ruin our
                        day. We stocked up on rain ponchos and covered all strollers. It's a good thing we did, because
                        after a few hours the rain settled and the park became even more fun. We met tons of Disney
                        characters. Epcot was by far the kids favorite park.</p>

                    <h3>Dinsey's Animal Kingdon</h3>
                    <p> Disney's Animal Kingdon was the top themepark for adults. We painted our faces using UV body
                        paint and we lit up in the Advatar attraction. After the park, we took a trip to the beach. We
                        had a blast and made the most of our last night in Disney World. </p>

                    <h2> Bye Bye, Disney!</h2>
                    <p> By the end of the trip, everyone was exhaused and ready to get home. We had an amazing
                        experience. I am very thankful that my family was able to experience things like flying on
                        an airplane, going to the beach and visiting the most magical place on earth: Walt Disney
                        World. We are all looking for the the 2020 family vacation!</p>
