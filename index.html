        <p>On July 4th of 2019, twenty-two memebers of my family embarked on our very first family vacation. In the
            begenning, I was hesitant. With only 6 adults and 16 children, I thought it would be a disaster. However,
            our 2019 family vacation turned out to be one of my favorite trips. </p>

        <h3> Traveling day:</h3>
        <p> Our first day was spent traveling. After getting the children packed and ready, we headed to the airport in
            5 seperate cars. Most of my family had never been on an air plane, so the ride to thhe airport was full of
            excitment and nervousness.
            We flew via Southwest Airlines </p>
